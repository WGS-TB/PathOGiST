# PathOGiST configuration file.
# This configuration file is in YAML file format, release 1.2 (Third Edition).
# Google yaml for the specification.
# Do not remove the sections 'genotyping', 'distances', 'thresholds', 'all_constraints', or 'output'.
# Remove all key-value pairs in the sections 'genotyping' or 'distances' if you want them blank.
# Remove all list items in the section 'fine_clusterings' if you want that blank, too.
# Keys from 'genotyping' and 'distances' sections should not overlap.
genotyping: 
    # Raw genotyping data from which to create distance matrices.
    # Accepted values are paths to text files containing paths to genotyping files.
    # Currently only compatible with SNPs from snippy, MLSTs from MentaLiST, and CNVs from PRINCE. 
    MLST: tests/integration_tests/test_data/yersinia_mentalist_calls.txt
distances:
    # Paths to pre-constructed distance matrices in tsv format.
    # You can also specify SNP, MLST and CNV distance matrices here if you pre-constructed them,
    # but then they shouldn't appear in the section 'genotyping'.
    SNP: tests/integration_tests/test_data/yersinia_snp_dist.tsv   
    kWIP: tests/integration_tests/test_data/yersinia_kwip_dist.tsv
fine_clusterings:
    # The genotyping datatypes that are considered to be the "finest".
    - SNP
thresholds:
    # Threshold values for performing correlation clustering on genotyping data types given above.
    # Every key appearing in the sections 'genotyping' and 'distances' should appear here with a value. 
    SNP: 2500 
    MLST: 300
    kWIP: 0.4
# Put the path for the final consensus clustering in tsv format here.
output: tests/integration_tests/test_data/yersinia_final_clustering.tsv
# Use all constraints when performing correlation and consensus clustering
